# The *Brunel Test*

- Realising a digitally built Britain is fundamentally a talent pipeline problem.
- Companies are not creating the conditions needed to attract and enable those who can solve this problem.

## The Joel Test:
- Created by Joel Splosky; Stack Overflow fame.
- What are the 12 questions every candidate should ask in an interview
- Everyone did badly
- Now people do much better
- Suspicious of '12's.

Insight -> Great candidates educating companies what they want.

Me :=
- I trained as a civil engineer
- cut my teeth holding my leveling stick at 3pm in the rain on the ELL
- worked on Blackfriars Bridge, the Olympics, some of the tallest buildings in London, etc.

- But, as much as I hate to admit it; I'm not any more- pushed to being an observer; waiting for a chance to return-
- Stint work on small big data; paralasing FEA.
- Just coming to the end of a contract on the latest strategy platform and tooling areodynamics for McLaren Racing teams
- Moving in to the wonderful world of IoT; startup.

And the funny thing is- keep meeting people like me- :=
- who _used_ to be engineers, architects, etc. and have
- left to go on and do data science; build robots; architect software platforms; become consultants, or disrupt the industry from the outside, etc.
- and we have exactly the same chat _"building things was amazing; but the industry is so frustrating"_
- The fact is- you're hemmeraging skills;
- and the reason is that you're not creating environments where the skills you _need_ can flourish;
- ask yourself why some of the best M&E engineers are training machines how to set the airconditioing at google rather than work on HS2?

Brunel Test := 
- obviously you're not paying enough- but money isn't everything.
- on a bus, Sunday morning. for a hackathon
- Evolved by asking people in industry
- but also- crucially- asking people with key skills who have left it: the Data Scientists, the Code shifters, the Makers, the Entrprenurs.

What environment do we expect :=

## Do you share and *contribute back to* open industry standards and tools?

__Will this company give me a way to shape the industry?__

- 
- Data Scientists are flocking to LinkedIn; 
- not because they're desperate to work out how to remove recruiters from all of our lives
- but because LinkedIn have built a reputation for leading the development of and sharing the *de facto* tools for Big Data.

## Do you *constantly deliver*?

__How efficient are you?__

- "
- Your one task is to deliver.
- If you can't do this continuously then you're content to be wasting time.
- McDonald's can manage this; why not us.

## Do you allow employees to *work remotely*?

__How good are you at collaborating?__

- "We need everyone together for those 'water cooler moments'" :(
- The industry is remote.
- AEC uses some of the most disparate teams out there.
- If you haven't worked out how to do this effectively with people in an environment you control,
- How can you be any good at working with those that don't?

## Do you use the *best tools* money can buy?

__Will you help me be the best me I can be?__

- "Project email is impossible" :(
- People are expensive,
- tools are cheap.
- If I think something has even a smallest chance of making me do something better; training, software, conferences
- give people support and they will grow.

## Do you use *open formats* exclusively?

__Do you own your creations?__

- "Do it in Revit first- then export to IFC" :(
- Proprietary formats are the enemy of insights and collaboration;
- if you're using them then someone else is already gatekeeping the innovations and worth you can dervive from them.

## Do you *develop your own tools* and have internal API's for all of your systems?

__Are you an inovator?__

- "Oh I think Marketing have that data" :(
- Someone who really wants to drive change doesn't want to just be a tool user
- they want to be able to build new tools so they can 
do the things people haven't done before.

## Do you use *rapid prototyping* to solve problems?

__Are you sitting on the bleeding edge?__

- "
- Work in a tangible space
- solving problems that have already been solved is not enough.
- Rapid prototyping- VR- 3D printing; working through them- saving time.

## Do you use *version control*?

__Have you worked out how to iterate effectively?__

- "Oh, you need spreadsheet version 2008-tmw-1" :(
- Have you got the foundations in place so we can all work together on the same thing?
- So that I can make small experiements offline from the designs, and them come back to them later?

## Do you *measure your solutions* and learn from the data you acquire?

__Are you evolving?__

- "I've never been back." :(
- I bet you no one can tell me how utilised your last structure was? How well did your last road work? How stupid is your smart building?
- If you can't tell me the answer then you can't tell me what you need to do better next time?

## Do you treat your data as an asset and *secure it* accordingly?

__Do you understand your product?__

- "I'll just e-mail you the password." :(
- Data is so important- to you, and your client.
- Have you, for example, put your BIM model including all the phyiscal security systems and location of the critical fiber optic lines on the cover of NCE magazine lately? (true story)

## Do you practice *continuous improvement*?

__Are you already content with me?__

- "We don't have the time to try that." :(
- If you don't think there's anything left to learn, then how can we do something new together? 
- Companies that do this well- where everyone sets an esoteric learning goal and reports back; as well as trying new styles of working and operating.

## Do you expect your suppliers to pass the Brunel Test and *help them to do so*?

__Is your supply chain important to you?__

- "I'm not sure how they'd do that." :(
- A great relationship with your supply chain is essential;
- If you don't realise that innovations can come from anywhere, then you haven't worked out the truth.

## Brunel Test

- This isn't theoretical. It's happening.
- I'm going to be asking your employees how you match up.
